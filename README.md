# DOO-you-The-MMM
DOO YOU?! The Mystery-Munchies-Maze

gr8 TEMPLATE for full Javacsript basics ->
1)async/promise animation... 
2)doubleButtons to get around .domContentLoaded(sound.play();) returning forced interactivity errors.
3) using form inputs to make conditional statements based on localStorage.setItem() and .getItem using ('haveKey', 'true')


 This is just a Little story through a scooby-doo based maze

Internal CSS and JS was used because of the 100 limited files allowed.

This would preferably be a full stack app:
kind of ironic/weird because such an idea would seem a little cheesy for all that effort 
kind of insane to have ended up putting as much effort as that sounds in the end.
(realized at very end the acronym for the app doubles as a food sound.)

this wasn't intended to be anything but a personal exercise on dancing around javascripts not allowing code to fire on .domContentLoaded
with automatic sounds....

This first part of the app is nothing much but a few double buttons to do that.

The second part has more double buttons:
clickCounter functions to create multi-purpose buttons.

super mvp/proof of concept promise/async based simple animations
(this is esp. why this'd be great as a TEMPLATE.)

got a few conditional statements that add and check localStorage
and can block the path based on that, which may arguably be the most MVP baby-database type functioning.

This Might be rambling, excuse me, but the visual side and progression of a little story would make the concept of targeting elements 
and event listeners a lot easier to grasp v.s. following more complex event listeners in a game like frogger.
           
fwc3rd@gmail.com if any1 wants full folder sent out, I have the original folder with external CSS and JS which is way easier to follow.
