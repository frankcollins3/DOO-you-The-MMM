gr8 TEMPLATE for full Javacsript basics -> async/promise animation... doubleButtons to get around .domContentLoaded(sound.play();) returning forced interactivity errors. Little story through a scooby-doo based maze



This would preferably be a full stack app:
kind if ironic/weird because such an idea would seem a little cheesy for all that effort 
kind of insane to have ended up putting as much effort as that sounds in the end.

this wasn't intended to be anything but a personal exercise on dancing around javascripts not allowing code to fire on .domContentLoaded
with automatic sounds....

This first part of the app is nothing much but a few double buttons to do that.

The second part has more double buttons:
clickCounter functions to create multi-purpose buttons.

super mvp/proof of concept promise/async based simple animations
(this is esp. why this'd be great as a TEMPLATE.)

This Might be rambling, excuse me, but the visual side and progression of little story would make the concept of targeting elements 
and event listeners the easiest to grasp.
V.S. a full game of frogger
